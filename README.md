# PHP-project (Betfree)

Betfree is a betting site that was made as a PHP project. Concept of this site is that the user can bet the outcome of the next NHL games 
for free, and the best "betters" will be rewarded each month or so. The page has a working user account system, database for the information
 of the user and some more necessary PHP features. 

The betting functionality of this web app is not working properly yet, since it uses JavaScript and it was not the main objective of this course.

The web application is done in PHP and Mysql, database in phpmyadmin, as well as some functionalities made with JavaScript.

For the styling of this page, we used CSS Bootstrap.
